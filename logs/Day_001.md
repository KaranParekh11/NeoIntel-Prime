## Observations
1. The chain system rewires the mind architecture slowly by atomic habits.
2. Small daily progress compounds into self-evolving intelligence.
3. Most people fail not because of complexity — but because they break the chain.

## Micro Experiment
- Created GitHub repository **NeoIntel-Prime**
- Created Notion Workspace
- Learned about the **Chain Protocol™**
